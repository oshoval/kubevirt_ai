# MCP Cluster Detection Test Report

**Agent Command**: python main.py --query 'test MCP cluster detection now that environment inheritance is fixed'

## Test Results

### Detection Results
- ✅ MCP tool `detect_kubevirtci_cluster` successfully detected cluster
- ✅ KUBECONFIG path correctly identified: `/home/oshoval/work/kubeconfig`
- ✅ Environment inheritance working properly

### Cluster Status
```
NAME     STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
node01   Ready    control-plane   39m   v1.33.4
node02   Ready    worker          38m   v1.33.4
```

### KubeVirt Status
```
NAME       AGE   PHASE
kubevirt   16m   Deployed
```

## Summary
- MCP cluster detection is working correctly
- Environment inheritance is functioning as expected
- Cluster is healthy with 2 nodes (1 control-plane, 1 worker)
- KubeVirt is deployed and in "Deployed" phase
- Ready for user operations

## Issues Found
None - all systems operational.

Date: $(date)

### KubeVirt Components Status
All KubeVirt components are running and healthy:
- virt-api: 2/2 pods running
- virt-controller: 2/2 pods running  
- virt-handler: 2/2 pods running (one per node)
- virt-operator: 2/2 pods running

### VM Operations Ready
- No existing VMs found in cluster
- Ready for VM creation and testing operations
- Cluster fully operational for user workloads

## Test Conclusion
✅ **MCP cluster detection test PASSED**
