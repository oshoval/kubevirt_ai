# VM Creation Test Bug Report - Iteration 1

**Agent Command:** python main.py --query 'Test simple VM creation: create a basic VM config file and report any issues to a bug file with full documentation'

## Summary

Successfully created a basic VM configuration file using virtctl but encountered infrastructure networking issues when attempting to deploy the VM.

## Successful Steps Performed

1. **Cluster Detection**: Successfully detected KubeVirtCI cluster k8s-1.33
2. **Documentation Access**: Retrieved latest user guide documentation for VM creation
3. **VM Configuration Creation**: Successfully generated VM config using:
   ```bash
   virtctl create vm --name test-basic-vm --memory 512Mi --termination-grace-period 0 --volume-containerdisk=src:quay.io/containerdisks/fedora
   ```
4. **YAML Output**: Generated valid VM manifest:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
   kind: VirtualMachine
   metadata:
     creationTimestamp: null
     name: test-basic-vm
   spec:
     runStrategy: Always
     template:
       metadata:
         creationTimestamp: null
       spec:
         domain:
           devices: {}
           memory:
             guest: 512Mi
           resources: {}
         terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
         volumes:
         - containerDisk:
             image: quay.io/containerdisks/fedora
           name: test-basic-vm-containerdisk-0
   status: {}
   ```
5. **VM Resource Creation**: Successfully applied VM to cluster - VM resource was created
6. **VMI Creation**: VirtualMachineInstance was properly created and scheduled

## Infrastructure Bug Found

**Bug Type**: Infrastructure/Networking Issue

**Issue**: VM launcher pod fails to start due to CNI networking error:
```
Failed to create pod sandbox: plugin type="calico" failed (add): cannot allocate new block due to per host block limit
```

**Impact**: Prevents VM from actually running, though VM creation workflow works correctly

**Status**: 
- VM: Created successfully 
- VMI: Stuck in "Scheduling" phase
- Pod: Failing to initialize due to networking

**Error Details**:
- Pod: `virt-launcher-test-basic-vm-fpnnm`
- Error: `cannot allocate new block due to per host block limit`
- CNI Plugin: Calico
- Multiple failed attempts to create pod sandbox

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Components
- virtctl command execution
- VM manifest generation
- VM resource creation
- VMI resource creation
- Pod scheduling to node

### ❌ Failed Components  
- Pod network sandbox creation
- VM runtime initialization
- Actual VM startup

## Documentation Assessment

The user documentation for VM creation is accurate and complete. The issue is not with the VM creation process itself but with the underlying cluster networking infrastructure.

## Recommendations

**For Admin/Infrastructure Team:**
1. Check Calico network pool configuration and IP block limits
2. Review cluster networking capacity
3. Consider expanding network block allocation per host
4. Verify cluster has sufficient IP ranges allocated

**For User Documentation:**
- No changes needed - the VM creation process worked as documented
- Consider adding troubleshooting section for common infrastructure issues

## Cleanup Performed

- Successfully deleted VM resource: `kubectl delete vm test-basic-vm`
- All created resources cleaned up properly

## Files Created
- `kubevirt_ai_agent_logs/test-basic-vm.yaml` - VM configuration file
- `kubevirt_ai_agent_logs/vm-creation-1-bugs.md` - This bug report
