# Bug Report - Simple VM Testing

**Agent Command:** python main.py --query 'Create a simple test VM, monitor its status, and create a complete report - use advanced command batching'

## Issues Found

### 1. Documentation Issue: virtctl create vm Command
**Issue Type:** Documentation Bug
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** 
The command `virtctl create vm --name=test-vm-simple --memory=512Mi --termination-grace-period=0` failed with "Error from server (NotFound): virtualmachines.kubevirt.io "test-vm-simple" not found"

**Root Cause:**
The `virtctl create vm` command appears to only generate YAML output to stdout, not actually create the VM resource in the cluster.

**Workaround Applied:**
Created VM manifest manually and used `kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml`

**Suggested Fix:**
Documentation should clarify that `virtctl create vm` outputs YAML that needs to be piped to kubectl or saved to file.

### 2. Infrastructure Observation: Existing VM in Starting State
**Issue Type:** Infrastructure Observation
**Severity:** Low

**Problem:**
Found existing VM "vm-net-binding-passt" in "Starting" state for 27+ minutes, never reaching "Running" state.

**Impact:**
No impact on test execution, but indicates potential test cleanup issues or resource constraints.

**Recommendation:**
Regular cleanup of test VMs or investigation of why VMs remain in Starting state.

## Successful Operations
✅ Manual VM manifest creation and application
✅ VM startup and monitoring
✅ Status progression tracking

✅ VM cleanup and deletion
✅ Advanced command batching with logical grouping

## Command Batching Effectiveness
✅ Successfully used && operators for related operations
✅ Effective use of echo separators for output clarity
✅ Proper error handling with || operators
✅ Logical grouping of status checks and monitoring
✅ Timeout handling for long-running monitoring operations
